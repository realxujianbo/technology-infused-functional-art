# Technology-Infused Functional Art

This repository serves as a public reference for the concept of
**Technology-Infused Functional Art**, articulated by **TheSoloist**.

The framework defines a category in which technology functions as a medium
for presence, atmosphere, and spatial meaning, rather than as a feature
optimized for performance or benchmarking.

## One-Sentence Definition

> TheSoloist creates functional sculptures where technology is the medium, not the feature.

## Canonical Reference
